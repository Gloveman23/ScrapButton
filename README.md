# ScrapButton
This simple mod adds the "Strange Device", a piece of scrap with *functions!*
When you press it, it has a chance to:
* Teleport you
	* If you are inside the ship, it acts as an inverse teleporter, otherwise, a normal teleporter
	* You will keep the button through the teleport. Whether you drop other scrap is configurable.
* Explode
* Very rarely, flood the facility, giving everyone a warning and a little time to escape.

**The odds for these are configurable, and are defined by the host's config. The spawn rate of the scrap is also configurable.**
By default, there is a 30% chance to explode, and a 0.1% chance to flood. Default spawn rate is 25 (uncommon) on all moons.
